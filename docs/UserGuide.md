## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TalentMatch.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

  * `listjob` : Lists all job entries.

  * `addjob jt/Software Developer jr/3 k/JavaScript`: Adds a job titled `Software Developer` to TalentMatch.

  * `deljob 3` : Deletes the 3rd job shown in the current list.

  * `clear` : Deletes all entries.

  * `exit` : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

### Command History

TalentMatch supports remembering command history, allowing you to be able to navigate through your past inputs and reduce the need to type out every command from scratch!<br>
Simply use the up and down arrow keys after clicking on the command box text input area and navigate through your past inputs like how you would in terminal.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [k/SKILL]` can be used as `n/John Doe k/Python` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[k/SKILL]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `k/Python`, `k/Java k/Python` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* All prefixes and commands used in TalentMatch are case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `N/NAME P/PHONE_NUMBER` is not acceptable.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `addjob jt/JOB_TITLE`, `ADDJOB JT/JOB_TITLE` is not acceptable.

* All parameters that accept alphanumeric characters are case-insensitive, except for `EMAIL`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Job commands should be called only in job view while person commands should be called only in person view. This is to ensure you can see real time updates in response to their queries.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

Here is a brief label of the various parameters:

![Application labels](images/Application_definitions.PNG)

### Adding an application: `addapp`

Adds an application to TalentMatch

Format: `addapp ip/PERSON_INDEX ij/JOB_INDEX`

<box type="tip" seamless>

* All applications start from the 0th round each time (start at 0 of JOB_ROUNDS when added).
* The `PERSON_INDEX` can be obtained by switching to Person View in TalentMatch.
* The `JOB_INDEX` can be obtained by switching to Job View in TalentMatch.
* `addapp` is the only application command that is available to you in both Person and Job view.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warnings:**
* Target person and job should already exist in TalentMatch prior to creation of an application for the target person and job.
* Person and job indices must be valid positive integers existing in the respective views.
  * **Important:** Person and job indices depend on the current state of the displayed list in Person and Job View.
* No existing applications must be present.
  TalentMatch flags duplicate applications for the same applicant and job out with this exception message:
  * `This application already exists in the address book Try using delapp instead!`

</box>

Expected output:<br>
`addapp ip/1 ij/4` adds an application which has the person at index 1 as the applicant and the job at index 4 as the job that he/she is applying for.

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

Examples:
* `addapp ip/3 ij/6` adds an application for the 3rd person to the 6th job in the current displayed person and job list respectively.

### Locating application: `findapp`

Finds application by `JOB_INDEX` and `APPLICATION_STATUS` in Job View.

Format: `findapp as/APPLICATION_STATUS [ij/JOB_INDEX]`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:**
* Both the job index and application status can be retrieved from the job view alone.
* Using `APPLICATION_STATUS` on its own returns all applications with the specified `APPLICATION_STATUS`.
* Using `APPLICATION_STATUS` and `JOB_INDEX` returns all applications under the specified job at `JOB_INDEX` with the specified `APPLICATION_STATUS`.
* `findapp` works on the current displayed list of jobs (i.e. if there are multiple jobs with applications with an `APPLICATION_STATUS` of 3 in TalentMatch, but only 1 job is currently displayed on the job list, `findapp as/3` returns only that 1 job).
* Use `listjob` to clear any existing filters to reset the search space to the entire job list.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warnings:**
* `JOB_INDEX` and `APPLICATION_STATUS` must be valid positive integers (exception of `APPLICATION_STATUS` having 0) existing in the respective views.
* The index **must be a natural number** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹
* **The desired application must already exist in TalentMatch**. TalentMatch cannot find a non-existent application!
* `findjob` can be used alongside `findapp`, however do note that all searches will search the current displayed list.
  * i.e. Suppose job A has 3 applications (2 of which have `APPLICATION_STATUS` of 2), `findapp as/2` returns all applications with `APPLICATION_STATUS` of 2, using `findjob A` after will return job A with only 2 applications shown (despite there existing 3 applications). 

</box>

Expected output:<br>
`findapp as/2` returns all applications in TalentMatch that currently have `APPLICATION_STATUS` of 2.

![img_6.png](img_6.png)

Example:
`findapp as/3 ij/2` returns all applications with `APPLICATION_STATUS` of 3 for the 2nd job in the displayed job list.

### Deleting an application: `delapp`

* `JOB_INDEX` and `APPLICATION_INDEX` must be valid positive integers existing in Job View.
* The index **must be a natural number** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹
* A unique existing application must be present.
  TalentMatch flags deleting non-existent applications with this exception message:
    * `This application does not exist in the address book. Try using addapp to add an application first!`

</box>

Expected output:<br>
`delapp ij/1 ia/1` deletes the 1st application for the 1st job.

![img_4.png](img_4.png)

Example:
`delapp ij/2 ia/3` deletes the 3rd application for the 2nd job.

### Advancing applications: `advapp`

Advances an application to the next round of interview.

Format: `advapp ij/JOB_INDEX ia/APPLICATION_INDEX`

* All applications are advanced by exactly 1 round each time.
* You should exercise discretion in advancing an application as it signifies that the applicant has not only
gone for the round, but also passed it! Therefore, an applicant who has reached the final round of an application (i.e. round 5 of 5) will
be deemed to have received a job offer. Congratulations!
* You should exercise discretion in advancing an application of any applicant who has reached the final round
of another application, as this would otherwise imply the applicant has more than 1 offers for this company!


<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warnings:**
* `JOB_INDEX` and `APPLICATION_INDEX` must be valid indices existing in Job View.
* The index **must be a natural number** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹
* **A unique existing application must be present.**
  TalentMatch flags advancing non-existent applications out with this exception message:

## Saving the data

TalentMatch data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TalentMatch stores data in two separate JSON files:
* `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` - Contains all person and job data
* `[JAR file location]/data/applicationbook.json` - Contains all application data linking persons to jobs

Advanced users can update data directly by editing these files, but caution is advised.

Do note that all case-insensitive fields are stored in lowercase in these files and casing is done automatically by TalentMatch.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data files make their format invalid, TalentMatch will handle it as follows:

1. If you correctly edit the files and maintain valid format:
   * TalentMatch will load your edited data on next startup
   * All relationships between persons, jobs, and applications will be preserved
   * Your changes will be immediately reflected in the UI

2. If the address book file is invalid or missing:
   * TalentMatch will load sample data for both persons/jobs and applications
   * A warning will be logged, but the application will still start

3. If only the applications file is invalid or missing:
   * TalentMatch will keep the existing persons/jobs data
   * It will create a new, empty applications manager
   * This means all links between persons and jobs will be lost

4. If both files are valid but contain inconsistencies:
   * Applications referring to non-existent persons or jobs may cause unexpected behavior

It is strongly recommended to:
* Back up both data files before editing them
* Keep the file format and data consistent across both files
* Restart the application after making direct edits to verify your changes

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Why are the commands limited to specific views?<br>
**A**: We limit commands to their specific views to ensure you are able to see real time updates in the GUI. This is in consideration of the case you type the wrong command and accidentally
change data in the other view unknowingly. 

**Q**: Why are the find commands so restrictive?<br>
**A**: TalentMatch is built with the assumption that experienced users will be unlikely to make typing mistakes when searching for a certain job/person, hence having a find function that continuously
reduces the search space improves your experience by being able to narrow down your displayed lists for easier addition of applications. In the event of typing a wrong keyword, you can use `list`/`listjob` in the 
appropriate view to reset your current search and try searching again.

**Q**: Why are skills limited to 1 word?<br>
**A**: TalentMatch follows typical resume formats where skills are listed as single words. In the event of skills that take up multiple words, you can compromise by
concatenating them into a single word.

## Known issues

### UI Issues
1. **Multiple Window Usages:** When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **Minimizing the Help Window:** If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Text Truncation in Display:** Long text entries may be truncated with "..." when the application window isn't wide enough. You may not be able to see the complete information for some fields.
4. **Viewport Issues:** Parts of the application may be cut off at smaller window sizes, including the default size at first startup. We have included a minimum viewport size for most devices, however in the case where your device is unable to support this viewport, then you may run into unexpected UI issues as mentioned before.
5. **Oversized Messages:** Some success and error messages may be too long to read easily in the current application.
6. **Inconsistent Casing:** TalentMatch automatically capitalizes the case-insensitive fields, which could result in weird capitalization in some cases.

### Data Storage Issues
6. **Storage File Synchronization:** The application generates two storage files: applicationsmanager.json and addressbook.json. Both files contain information related to persons and jobs. If you make changes to persons or jobs in one file, you MUST replicate these changes in the other file. Failure to synchronize these files will result in data mismatches when the application loads, leading to undefined application behavior.
7. **Command Syntax Sensitivity:** Any non-adherence to the case sensitivity and input validation rules given in the command descriptions may cause unexpected errors. You should read through and follow these case sensitivity and input validation rules carefully.
8. **Multiple Instance Conflicts:** Running multiple instances of the application simultaneously can corrupt your data files. You should only run one instance of TalentMatch at a time. Close any existing instance before opening a new one.
9. **Skill Storage Limitation:** Adding skills that are more than 1 word long will result in an error. You can concatenate the skill into a single word before adding them as a compromise.
